## Executive Summary

Phase 2 of the `pgtrickle-relay` CLI extends the v0.25.0 foundation with
additional backends for major cloud platforms and analytics systems, plus
operational improvements that make the relay production-grade at scale.

Phase 2 also introduces **Singer protocol support** — the single highest-value
connector integration. One Singer adapter unlocks hundreds of community-maintained
taps and targets via the Meltano SDK ecosystem. Lightweight **n8n and Zapier
webhook flavors** are included as thin formatting layers over the existing
webhook backend.

**Phase 1 (v0.25.0)** ships with 8 sink backends (NATS, Kafka, HTTP webhook,
Redis Streams, SQS, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL inbox, stdout/file) and 7 source
backends (same minus stdout, plus stdin). Phase 2 adds **10 new backends**
covering all three major cloud providers, the IoT ecosystem, analytics
databases, and data lake storage.

Beyond backends, Phase 2 introduces **10 operational improvements**: dead-letter
queues, schema registry integration, message transforms, content-based routing,
rate limiting, circuit breakers, SIGHUP config reload, dry-run/replay mode,
OpenTelemetry tracing, and webhook signature verification. The relay dashboard,
plugin system, and payload encryption are deferred to Phase 3.

> **Note:** Multi-pipeline support and database-driven hot-reload are already
> part of Phase 1 (v0.25.0) — the relay natively runs multiple independent
> pipelines via `relay_outbox_config` / `relay_inbox_config` SQL tables and
> reloads on every `NOTIFY pgtrickle_relay_config` event.
>
> **Configuration model:** The TOML-like blocks shown throughout Part A and
> Part B are **examples of the `config` JSONB column format** stored in
> `pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config` / `pgtrickle.relay_inbox_config`, displayed
> in TOML syntax for readability. The relay binary has no config file — all
> pipeline configuration is managed via SQL.

---

## Part A — Additional Backends

Each backend is implemented as both a Source and Sink where the system
supports bidirectional communication. Read-only or write-only systems
implement only the relevant trait.

### A.1 Google Cloud Pub/Sub

**Why:** Second-largest cloud messaging platform after AWS. Every GCP-native
organisation needs this. Pub/Sub is Google's equivalent of SQS + SNS combined.

**Crate:** `google-cloud-pubsub` or `gcloud-sdk`

**Direction:** Source + Sink (bidirectional)

#### Sink Configuration

```toml
[sink.gcp-pubsub]
project_id = "my-project"
topic = "pgtrickle-events"
# topic_template = "pgtrickle.{stream_table}"
# ordering_key_template = "{outbox_id}"    # for ordered delivery
# credentials_file = "/etc/gcp/sa.json"    # default: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
# endpoint = "pubsub.googleapis.com:443"   # for emulator: localhost:8085
# batch_max_messages = 1000
# batch_max_bytes = 10485760               # 10 MiB
# publish_timeout_ms = 60000
```

**Dedup:** Uses Pub/Sub's message attributes with `pgt_dedup_key` attribute.
Consumers implement dedup via Dataflow or Cloud Functions idempotency.

**Ordering:** Supports ordering keys for FIFO semantics within a partition.

#### Source Configuration

```toml
[source.gcp-pubsub]
project_id = "my-project"
subscription = "pgtrickle-inbox-sub"
# credentials_file = "/etc/gcp/sa.json"
# max_messages = 100
# ack_deadline_seconds = 30
# endpoint = "pubsub.googleapis.com:443"
```

**Consumption model:** Pull subscription. Messages are acknowledged only
after successful inbox write. Nacked messages are redelivered after the
ack deadline.

**Dedup key:** Uses `pgt_dedup_key` message attribute if present; otherwise
uses Pub/Sub `message_id`.

### A.2 Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

**Why:** AWS's streaming platform for high-throughput, ordered event streams.
Different trade-offs from SQS: ordered within shards, higher throughput,
longer retention (up to 365 days).

**Crate:** `aws-sdk-kinesis`

**Direction:** Source + Sink (bidirectional)

#### Sink Configuration

```toml
[sink.kinesis]
stream_name = "pgtrickle-events"
# region = "us-east-1"
# partition_key_template = "{stream_table}"
# explicit_hash_key = ""                    # optional shard targeting
# batch_size = 500                          # records per PutRecords call (max 500)
# aggregation = true                        # KPL-compatible aggregation
```

**Dedup:** Kinesis does not deduplicate natively. The relay sets a
`pgt_dedup_key` field in the record data. Consumer-side dedup is required.

**Ordering:** Records are ordered within a shard by partition key.

#### Source Configuration

```toml
[source.kinesis]
stream_name = "external-events"
# region = "us-east-1"
# iterator_type = "TRIM_HORIZON"           # TRIM_HORIZON | LATEST | AT_TIMESTAMP
# at_timestamp = "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"    # when iterator_type = AT_TIMESTAMP
# checkpoint_table = "pgtrickle_kinesis_checkpoints"  # DynamoDB or PG table
# poll_interval_ms = 1000
```

**Consumption model:** Uses `GetShardIterator` + `GetRecords`. Checkpoints
shard positions in a PostgreSQL table (or DynamoDB). Handles shard splits
and merges.

### A.3 Azure Service Bus

**Why:** Primary enterprise messaging platform for Azure. Equivalent of
SQS + RabbitMQ for Microsoft ecosystem customers. Supports queues, topics,
and subscriptions with advanced features (sessions, dead-letter, scheduling).

**Protocol note:** Uses AMQP 1.0 natively (different from RabbitMQ's AMQP 0-9-1).
If AMQP 1.0 backend is prioritized in Phase 3, Service Bus could use the generic
AMQP 1.0 implementation.

**Crate:** `azure_messaging_servicebus`

**Direction:** Source + Sink (bidirectional)

#### Sink Configuration

```toml
[sink.azure-servicebus]
connection_string = "Endpoint=sb://mybus.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=...;SharedAccessKey=..."
# Or use managed identity:
# namespace = "mybus.servicebus.windows.net"
queue_or_topic = "pgtrickle-events"
# session_id = ""                           # for session-enabled queues
# message_ttl_seconds = 86400              # 24 hours
# schedule_enqueue_time = ""               # delayed delivery
# batch_size = 100                          # messages per send batch
```

**Dedup:** Uses `MessageId` property set to the dedup key. Service Bus
supports native dedup on queues with `RequiresDuplicateDetection` enabled.

#### Source Configuration

```toml
[source.azure-servicebus]
connection_string = "Endpoint=sb://..."
queue_or_topic = "inbox-events"
# subscription = "pgtrickle-relay"         # for topic subscriptions
# receive_mode = "PeekLock"               # PeekLock | ReceiveAndDelete
# max_messages = 10
# max_wait_seconds = 30
# prefetch_count = 100
```

**Consumption model:** Uses `PeekLock` mode. Messages are completed only
after successful inbox write. Abandoned messages are returned to the queue.

### A.4 Azure Event Hubs

**Why:** Azure's Kafka-compatible streaming platform. Many Azure customers
use Event Hubs instead of self-managed Kafka. Supports the Kafka protocol
natively, but also has its own SDK with better Azure integration.

**Crate:** `azure_messaging_eventhubs` or use `rdkafka` with Kafka protocol

**Direction:** Source + Sink (bidirectional)

#### Sink Configuration

```toml
[sink.azure-eventhubs]
connection_string = "Endpoint=sb://myhub.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=...;SharedAccessKey=..."
event_hub_name = "pgtrickle-events"
# partition_key_template = "{stream_table}"
# batch_max_bytes = 1048576                # 1 MiB per batch
# Or use Kafka protocol (reuse existing Kafka sink):
# [sink.kafka]
# brokers = "myhub.servicebus.windows.net:9093"
# security_protocol = "SASL_SSL"
# sasl_mechanism = "PLAIN"
# sasl_username = "$ConnectionString"
# sasl_password = "Endpoint=sb://..."
```

**Note:** Since Event Hubs supports the Kafka protocol, users can also use the
existing Kafka sink/source with Event Hubs connection details. The native SDK
provides better integration with Azure identity, diagnostics, and checkpointing.

#### Source Configuration

```toml
[source.azure-eventhubs]
connection_string = "Endpoint=sb://..."
event_hub_name = "external-events"
consumer_group = "$Default"
# checkpoint_store = "postgres"            # postgres | azure-blob
# starting_position = "earliest"           # earliest | latest
```

**Consumption model:** Event processor with partition ownership and
checkpointing. Checkpoints stored in PostgreSQL or Azure Blob Storage.

### A.5 Apache Pulsar

> **Deferred to Phase 3.** Full design: [PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md § B.1](./PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md#b1-apache-pulsar)

### A.6 MQTT (v5)

**Why:** The dominant IoT messaging protocol. MQTT v5 is supported by
Mosquitto, HiveMQ, EMQX, VerneMQ, and every cloud IoT platform (AWS IoT
Core, Azure IoT Hub, GCP IoT Core). Enables pg-trickle to bridge device
telemetry into stream tables.

**Crate:** `rumqttc`

**Direction:** Source + Sink (bidirectional)

#### Sink Configuration

```toml
[sink.mqtt]
url = "mqtt://localhost:1883"
# url = "mqtts://broker.hivemq.com:8883"   # TLS
topic_template = "pgtrickle/{stream_table}/{op}"
# client_id = "pgtrickle-relay"
# qos = 1                                  # 0 = at most once, 1 = at least once, 2 = exactly once
# retain = false
# username = "user"
# password = "pass"
# keep_alive_seconds = 60
# clean_start = true
# tls_ca = "/etc/mqtt/ca.pem"
# tls_cert = "/etc/mqtt/cert.pem"
# tls_key = "/etc/mqtt/key.pem"
# max_packet_size = 268435456              # 256 MiB (MQTT v5)
```

**Dedup:** MQTT v5 does not have native dedup. The relay sets a
`pgt_dedup_key` user property. Consumer-side dedup required.

**QoS levels:**
- QoS 0: Fire-and-forget (fastest, may lose messages)
- QoS 1: At-least-once (default — matches relay semantics)
- QoS 2: Exactly-once (slowest, broker-level guarantee)

#### Source Configuration

```toml
[source.mqtt]
url = "mqtt://localhost:1883"
topic = "devices/+/telemetry"              # MQTT topic filter with wildcards
# client_id = "pgtrickle-inbox"
# qos = 1
# clean_start = false                      # persistent session for offline buffering
# username = "user"
# password = "pass"
```

**Consumption model:** Subscribes to the topic filter. Messages are
processed as they arrive. With QoS 1+, the broker retransmits if the
relay doesn't acknowledge within the keep-alive interval.

**Use-cases:**
- IoT device telemetry → pg-trickle inbox → stream table analytics
- Edge sensor data aggregation
- Smart home / building automation event streams

### A.7 Elasticsearch / OpenSearch

**Why:** Dominant search and analytics engine. Natural fit for CDC: every
data change in pg-trickle can be indexed for full-text search and
real-time dashboards. Used by nearly every mid-to-large engineering team.

**Crate:** `elasticsearch` (official) or `opensearch`

**Direction:** Sink only (write — search engines are not message sources)

#### Sink Configuration

```toml
[sink.elasticsearch]
url = "https://localhost:9200"
index_template = "pgtrickle-{stream_table}"
# index_date_pattern = "%Y.%m"             # monthly indices: pgtrickle-orders-2026.04
# doc_id_template = "{dedup_key}"          # Elasticsearch _id for upserts
# pipeline = "my-ingest-pipeline"          # ingest pipeline
# username = "elastic"
# password = "changeme"
# api_key = "base64-encoded-key"
# tls_ca = "/etc/elasticsearch/ca.pem"
# bulk_max_actions = 1000                  # actions per _bulk request
# bulk_max_bytes = 5242880                 # 5 MiB per _bulk request
# bulk_flush_interval_ms = 1000
# refresh_policy = "false"                 # true | false | wait_for
# op_type = "index"                        # index | create
# routing_template = "{stream_table}"
```

**Operations mapping:**
- `op = "insert"` → Elasticsearch `index` (upsert by `_id`)
- `op = "delete"` → Elasticsearch `delete` (by `_id`)
- `is_full_refresh = true` → Delete-by-query + bulk index (atomic swap
  via index alias rotation)

**Bulk API:** Uses the `_bulk` API for efficient batching. Each batch
from the relay loop is translated to a single `_bulk` request.

**Full-refresh handling:** For full-refresh batches, the sink:
1. Creates a new index with a timestamped suffix
2. Bulk-indexes all rows
3. Swaps the index alias atomically
4. Deletes the old index

**OpenSearch compatibility:** Set `flavor = "opensearch"` in config. The
same code path works for both — the bulk API is compatible.

```toml
[sink.elasticsearch]
url = "https://localhost:9200"
flavor = "opensearch"                      # elasticsearch (default) | opensearch
```

### A.8 Object Storage (S3 / GCS / Azure Blob)

**Why:** Data lake integration. Every modern data stack stores analytical
data in object storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob). Enables pg-trickle deltas
to flow into Parquet/JSON files for consumption by Spark, dbt, Trino,
DuckDB, and other analytics tools.

**Crate:** `aws-sdk-s3`, `google-cloud-storage`, `azure_storage_blobs`

**Direction:** Sink only (write — not a real-time message source)

#### Sink Configuration

```toml
[sink.object-storage]
provider = "s3"                            # s3 | gcs | azure-blob
bucket = "my-data-lake"
prefix = "pgtrickle/{stream_table}"
# region = "us-east-1"                     # S3/GCS
# account_name = "mystorageaccount"        # Azure Blob
# container_name = "pgtrickle"             # Azure Blob (instead of bucket)

# Output format
format = "jsonl"                           # jsonl | parquet | csv
# compression = "gzip"                     # none | gzip | zstd | snappy (jsonl/csv)
# parquet_compression = "zstd"             # none | snappy | gzip | lz4 | zstd

# Partitioning
partition_by = "date"                      # none | date | hour | custom
# partition_template = "year={%Y}/month={%m}/day={%d}"
# file_prefix = "pgtrickle"
# file_suffix_format = "{timestamp}_{batch_id}"

# Batching (buffer locally, flush periodically)
buffer_max_rows = 100000                   # rows per file
buffer_max_bytes = 268435456               # 256 MiB per file
buffer_max_seconds = 300                   # flush every 5 minutes

# Credentials (default: from environment/instance profile)
# aws_access_key_id = "..."
# aws_secret_access_key = "..."
# gcs_credentials_file = "/etc/gcp/sa.json"
# azure_connection_string = "..."
```

**Partitioning:** Files are organised into date-based or custom partition
layouts compatible with Hive-style partitioning (`year=2026/month=04/...`).

**Parquet support:** Uses the `parquet` crate to write columnar files.
Schema is inferred from the first batch or a user-provided schema file.

**Exactly-once file writes:** Each file is written to a temporary prefix,
then renamed atomically (S3 CopyObject + DeleteObject; GCS compose; Azure
staged upload). On relay crash, orphaned temp files are cleaned up on
restart.

**Full-refresh handling:** Writes a complete snapshot file with a
`_full_refresh` suffix. Downstream consumers can detect and handle
accordingly.

### A.9 ClickHouse

**Why:** Fastest-growing OLAP database. Ideal destination for pg-trickle
change data — enables real-time analytics dashboards over streaming data.
ClickHouse is deployed by Cloudflare, Uber, eBay, Spotify, and thousands
of companies for real-time analytics.

**Crate:** `clickhouse` (official Rust client)

**Direction:** Sink only (write — analytics database, not a message source)

#### Sink Configuration

```toml
[sink.clickhouse]
url = "http://localhost:8123"
database = "default"
table = "pgtrickle_events"
# table_template = "pgtrickle_{stream_table}"
# username = "default"
# password = ""
# insert_batch_size = 10000                # rows per INSERT
# insert_timeout_ms = 30000
# compression = "lz4"                      # none | lz4
# async_insert = true                      # ClickHouse async inserts
# wait_for_async_insert = false
# tls_ca = "/etc/clickhouse/ca.pem"
```

**Operations mapping:**
- `op = "insert"` → ClickHouse `INSERT` into a `ReplacingMergeTree` or
  `CollapsingMergeTree` (depending on user's table engine)
- `op = "delete"` → Insert with sign=-1 for `CollapsingMergeTree`, or
  use `ALTER TABLE ... DELETE` for `MergeTree`
- `is_full_refresh = true` → `TRUNCATE TABLE` + bulk `INSERT`

**Engine recommendations (documented, not enforced):**
- `ReplacingMergeTree` for upsert semantics (most common)
- `CollapsingMergeTree` for efficient deletes with insert+delete pairs
- `MergeTree` for append-only event logs

**Async inserts:** ClickHouse can buffer inserts server-side for higher
throughput. The relay supports this via the `async_insert` setting.

### A.10 Apache Arrow Flight / gRPC

> **Deferred to Phase 3.** Full design: [PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md § B.2](./PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md#b2-apache-arrow-flight--grpc)

### A.11 Singer Protocol (Meltano SDK)

**Why:** Singer is the widest connector ecosystem in data engineering — hundreds
of community-maintained taps (sources) and targets (destinations) covering
SaaS APIs, databases, data warehouses, and file formats. One Singer adapter
unlocks the entire [Meltano Hub](https://hub.meltano.com) catalog. The wire
protocol is trivial: newline-delimited JSON messages (SCHEMA → RECORD → STATE)
over stdin/stdout.

**Protocol:** [Singer Spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md)
— no SDK dependency in Rust, just the JSON-lines wire format.

**Crate:** None required — `serde_json` + `tokio::process` for subprocess I/O.

**Direction:** Source + Sink (bidirectional)

#### Sink Configuration (Forward: outbox → Singer Target)

The relay spawns a Singer target subprocess and pipes pg-trickle delta
envelopes as Singer RECORD messages to its stdin.

```json
{
  "sink_type": "singer",
  "sink": {
    "target_command": "target-bigquery",
    "target_config": {
      "project_id": "my-project",
      "dataset_id": "pgtrickle"
    },
    "stream_name_template": "{stream_table}",
    "batch_size": 1000,
    "state_checkpoint_interval": 100,
    "target_args": ["--config", "/etc/singer/target-config.json"]
  }
}
```

**Message mapping:**
- On first batch or schema change → emit Singer `SCHEMA` message with
  JSON Schema inferred from the delta payload columns.
- Each delta row → Singer `RECORD` message with `stream`, `record`,
  and `time_extracted` fields.
- After each batch → emit Singer `STATE` message with the relay's
  consumer group offset. The target writes state to stdout, which the
  relay captures for crash-recovery checkpointing.

**Operations mapping:**
- `op = "insert"` → RECORD with `_sdc_extracted_at` and `_sdc_batched_at`
- `op = "delete"` → RECORD with `_sdc_deleted_at` set (soft-delete convention)
- `is_full_refresh = true` → Singer `ACTIVATE_VERSION` message (Meltano SDK
  extension) to signal full-refresh semantics to the target.

#### Source Configuration (Reverse: Singer Tap → inbox)

The relay spawns a Singer tap subprocess and reads RECORD messages from
its stdout, converting each to an inbox row.

```json
{
  "source_type": "singer",
  "source": {
    "tap_command": "tap-salesforce",
    "tap_config": {
      "client_id": "...",
      "client_secret": "...",
      "refresh_token": "..."
    },
    "tap_args": ["--config", "/etc/singer/tap-config.json", "--catalog", "/etc/singer/catalog.json"],
    "state_file": "/var/lib/pgtrickle-relay/singer-state.json"
  }
}
```

**Consumption model:**
1. Relay spawns the tap subprocess.
2. Reads stdout line-by-line, parsing JSON messages.
3. `SCHEMA` messages → stored in memory for validation.
4. `RECORD` messages → converted to inbox rows and batch-inserted.
5. `STATE` messages → checkpointed to PostgreSQL. On restart, the
   saved state is passed to the tap via `--state`.

**State management:** STATE messages are stored in a
`pgtrickle.relay_singer_state` table keyed by pipeline name. On crash
recovery, the relay writes the last state to a temp file and passes
it to the tap's `--state` argument.

**Error handling:**
- Tap crash → relay logs error, waits `restart_delay_seconds` (default: 30),
  restarts from last checkpoint.
- Target crash → messages are routed to DLQ (if enabled).
- Malformed JSON lines → logged and skipped (or DLQ'd).

### A.12 Webhook Flavors (n8n / Zapier)

**Why:** The existing webhook backend already supports n8n's "Webhook" trigger
node and Zapier's "Webhooks by Zapier" trigger. These flavors add
platform-specific envelope formatting so payloads arrive in the expected
shape without user-side transforms.

**Implementation:** Thin formatting layer over the existing `webhook` sink —
no new crate dependencies.

#### n8n Flavor

```json
{
  "sink_type": "webhook",
  "sink": {
    "url": "https://n8n.example.com/webhook/abc-123",
    "flavor": "n8n",
    "n8n_workflow_id": "42",
    "include_metadata": true
  }
}
```

**Payload shape:** Wraps the delta payload in n8n's expected structure:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "stream_table": "orders_stream",
    "op": "insert",
    "data": { /* delta columns */ },
    "metadata": {
      "dedup_key": "...",
      "timestamp": "...",
      "workflow_id": "42"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Zapier Flavor

```json
{
  "sink_type": "webhook",
  "sink": {
    "url": "https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/12345/abcdef/",
    "flavor": "zapier"
  }
}
```

**Payload shape:** Flat key-value structure (Zapier prefers flat objects):

```json
{
  "stream_table": "orders_stream",
  "op": "insert",
  "dedup_key": "...",
  "timestamp": "...",

## Part B — CLI Extensions & Improvements

### B.1 Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)

**Problem:** Phase 1 logs and skips poison messages. Production deployments
need a way to inspect, retry, and manage failed messages.

**Design:** A DLQ table in PostgreSQL stores failed messages with error
context. Failed messages are moved to the DLQ instead of being silently
skipped.

```sql
CREATE TABLE pgtrickle.relay_dlq (
    id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    relay_mode      TEXT NOT NULL,         -- 'forward' | 'reverse'
    source_name     TEXT NOT NULL,         -- e.g. 'outbox:order_events'
    sink_name       TEXT NOT NULL,         -- e.g. 'nats'
    dedup_key       TEXT NOT NULL,
    subject         TEXT,
    payload         JSONB NOT NULL,
    error_message   TEXT NOT NULL,
    error_kind      TEXT NOT NULL,         -- 'decode' | 'sink_permanent' | 'inbox_permanent'
    attempt_count   INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    first_failed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    last_failed_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    retried_at      TIMESTAMPTZ,          -- set when retried
    resolved        BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false
);
```

**SQL API** (all DLQ management is done via SQL functions — no CLI subcommands):

```sql
-- Inspect pending DLQ entries
SELECT * FROM pgtrickle.relay_dlq_list();

-- Retry a specific message by id
SELECT pgtrickle.relay_dlq_retry(id := 42);

-- Retry all pending messages
SELECT pgtrickle.relay_dlq_retry_all();

-- Purge resolved entries older than N days
SELECT pgtrickle.relay_dlq_purge(retention_days := 30);

-- Summary by error_kind
SELECT * FROM pgtrickle.relay_dlq_stats();
```

**Pipeline config** (in the `config` column of `relay_outbox_config` / `relay_inbox_config`):

```json
{
  "dlq": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_retries": 5,
    "retry_delay_seconds": 60,
    "retention_days": 30
  }
}
```

**Effort:** 2d

### B.2 Schema Registry Integration (Avro / Protobuf)

**Problem:** Phase 1 passes JSON payloads through as-is. Many organisations
use Avro or Protobuf with a schema registry (Confluent, Apicurio, AWS Glue)
for type safety, schema evolution, and compact wire formats.

**Design:** The relay can serialise outgoing messages to Avro/Protobuf
using a schema registry, and deserialise incoming messages from Avro/Protobuf
to JSON for inbox insertion.

```toml
[schema_registry]
url = "http://localhost:8081"             # Confluent Schema Registry
# type = "confluent"                      # confluent | apicurio | aws-glue
# username = "user"
# password = "pass"

[forward.serialization]
format = "avro"                           # json (default) | avro | protobuf
# subject_name_strategy = "TopicName"     # TopicName | RecordName | TopicRecordName
# schema_id = 1                           # pin to a specific schema version
# auto_register = true                    # register schema if not found

[reverse.deserialization]
format = "avro"                           # json (default) | avro | protobuf
# Convert to JSON before inbox insert (always — inbox stores JSONB)
```

**Crates:** `apache-avro`, `schema_registry_converter`, `prost`

**Effort:** 3d

### B.3 Message Transforms (JMESPath)

**Problem:** Users sometimes need lightweight payload transformations:
field selection, renaming, or simple computations — without deploying a
separate stream processor.

**Design:** Optional JMESPath expressions that transform the payload
before publishing to the sink (forward) or writing to the inbox (reverse).

```toml
[transform]
# Select specific fields
payload = "{ order_id: id, customer: customer_name, total: amount }"

# Filter: only relay messages matching a condition
filter = "status == 'completed'"

# Add computed fields
enrich = "merge(@, { relayed_at: `now()` })"
```

**Scope limitation:** Transforms are intentionally lightweight. For complex
ETL, users should use the stream table query itself or a downstream
processor (Kafka Streams, Flink, etc.).

**Crate:** `jmespath`

**Effort:** 1.5d

### B.4 Content-Based Routing

**Problem:** Phase 1 uses static subject/topic templates. Production
deployments often need to route messages to different topics based on
payload content (e.g. different Kafka topics per event type).

**Design:** Routing rules that evaluate payload fields and map to
different subjects/topics.

```toml
[routing]
# Default template (Phase 1 — still supported)
subject_template = "pgtrickle.{stream_table}"

# Content-based routing rules (evaluated in order, first match wins)
[[routing.rules]]
match = "event_type == 'order.created'"
subject = "orders.created"

[[routing.rules]]
match = "event_type == 'order.shipped'"
subject = "orders.shipped"

[[routing.rules]]
match = "priority > 5"
subject = "high-priority.{stream_table}"

# Fallback if no rule matches
[routing.default]
subject = "pgtrickle.unmatched"
```

**Expression language:** Reuses JMESPath (same dependency as B.3) for
match conditions.

**Effort:** 1d

### B.5 Rate Limiting & Back-Pressure

**Problem:** A fast outbox poller can overwhelm a slow sink or exceed
API rate limits (e.g. webhook endpoints, SQS quotas).

**Design:** Configurable rate limiter applied between the relay loop
and the sink.

```toml
[rate_limit]
enabled = true
max_messages_per_second = 1000            # 0 = unlimited
max_bytes_per_second = 10485760           # 10 MiB/s; 0 = unlimited
burst_size = 2000                         # allow short bursts above the limit
# strategy = "token_bucket"               # token_bucket | sliding_window
```

**Back-pressure propagation:** When the rate limiter is full, the relay
pauses polling from the source. This propagates back-pressure upstream:

- **Forward:** Outbox poller sleeps, leaving rows in the outbox for
  other consumers or future polls.
- **Reverse:** Source broker retains messages until the relay is ready.

**Crate:** `governor`

**Effort:** 1d

### B.6 Circuit Breaker

**Problem:** When a sink is down, the relay retries indefinitely with
exponential backoff. In a multi-pipeline deployment, a single broken
sink can cause cascading issues.

**Design:** Circuit breaker pattern with configurable thresholds.

```toml
[circuit_breaker]
enabled = true
failure_threshold = 5                     # open circuit after 5 consecutive failures
success_threshold = 3                     # close circuit after 3 consecutive successes
half_open_timeout_seconds = 30            # try one request after this delay
reset_timeout_seconds = 300               # force reset after 5 minutes
```

**States:**
- **Closed:** Normal operation. Failures increment the counter.
- **Open:** All publish attempts fail immediately. Emit
  `relay_circuit_breaker_state{state="open"}` metric.
- **Half-open:** Allow one request through. On success, close; on failure,
  re-open.

**Integration with DLQ:** When the circuit is open, messages are routed
to the DLQ (if enabled) rather than blocking the relay loop.

**Effort:** 1d

### B.7 Multi-Pipeline Mode

> **Already implemented in Phase 1.** The relay has supported multiple
> independent pipelines per process from day one. This section documents
> the existing behaviour for completeness.

Each row in `pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config` or `pgtrickle.relay_inbox_config`
with `enabled = true` spawns an independent tokio worker task with its own
metrics labels (`pipeline=<name>`). PostgreSQL connections are pooled via
`deadpool-postgres`. No per-pipeline process or config file is needed.

```sql
-- Forward order_events to both Kafka and webhook simultaneously
INSERT INTO pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config (name, config) VALUES
  ('orders-to-kafka',
   '{"source_type": "outbox", "source": {"outbox": "order_events", "group": "orders-kafka"},
     "sink_type": "kafka", "sink": {"brokers": "localhost:9092", "topic": "orders"}}'),
  ('orders-to-webhook',
   '{"source_type": "outbox", "source": {"outbox": "order_events", "group": "orders-webhook"},
     "sink_type": "webhook", "sink": {"url": "https://api.example.com/orders"}}');

-- Reverse: MQTT device telemetry → inbox
INSERT INTO pgtrickle.relay_inbox_config (name, config) VALUES
  ('iot-to-inbox',
   '{"source_type": "mqtt", "source": {"url": "mqtt://broker:1883", "topic": "devices/+/telemetry"},
     "sink_type": "pg-inbox", "sink": {"inbox_table": "device_telemetry"}}');
```

Each pipeline runs as an independent tokio task. Enable or disable a pipeline
at any time without restarting the relay:

```sql
UPDATE pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config SET enabled = false WHERE name = 'orders-to-webhook';
-- The relay picks up the change within milliseconds via LISTEN/NOTIFY.
```

**Effort:** *(none — already in Phase 1)*

### B.8 SIGHUP Reload

> **Database-driven hot-reload is already in Phase 1.** Every change to
> `relay_outbox_config` or `relay_inbox_config` — including adding, removing,
> enabling, disabling, or modifying any pipeline's `config` JSONB — triggers
> a `NOTIFY pgtrickle_relay_config` event and is applied within milliseconds
> without restarting the process. The relay has no config file.

**What Phase 2 adds:** A `SIGHUP` handler so operators can force a full
config reload from the database on demand, matching common Unix daemon
conventions and simplifying runbooks.

```bash
# Force reload without restarting the relay process
kill -HUP $(pidof pgtrickle-relay)
# In Kubernetes:
kubectl exec -it relay-pod -- kill -HUP 1
```

On receiving `SIGHUP`, the relay:
1. Re-queries `relay_outbox_config` and `relay_inbox_config` for all rows.
2. Starts tasks for newly enabled pipelines.
3. Cancels tasks for disabled or deleted pipelines.
4. Restarts tasks whose `config` JSONB has changed.

**Not live-reloadable** (require full process restart):
- `--postgres-url` / `PGTRICKLE_RELAY_POSTGRES_URL`
- `--metrics-addr`
- `--log-format`

**Effort:** 0.5d

### B.9 Dry-Run & Replay Mode

**Problem:** Operators need to test relay configuration without actually
publishing messages. They also need to replay historical outbox entries
(e.g. after adding a new sink).

**Design:** Both modes are configured as per-pipeline flags in the `config`
JSONB column. There are no additional CLI arguments — the relay is always
started with the same minimal command (`pgtrickle-relay --postgres-url ...`).

#### Dry-Run Mode

Enable dry-run on a specific pipeline by setting `"dry_run": true` in its
config. The relay logs what would be published (subject, dedup key, payload
size) without sending anything to the sink.

```sql
-- Enable dry-run for a pipeline
UPDATE pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config
   SET config = config || '{"dry_run": true}'
 WHERE name = 'orders-to-kafka';

-- Disable dry-run (return to live)
UPDATE pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config
   SET config = config - 'dry_run'
 WHERE name = 'orders-to-kafka';
```

- Validates all config, connections, and permissions.
- Useful for testing routing rules, transforms, and new sink configs.
- The change is picked up within milliseconds via LISTEN/NOTIFY.

#### Replay Mode

Replay a range of outbox entries by setting `replay` in the pipeline config.
The relay reads the specified offset range without committing consumer group
offsets, then automatically clears the replay config when complete.

```sql
-- Replay outbox entries 1000–5000 for a pipeline
UPDATE pgtrickle.relay_outbox_config
   SET config = config || '{"replay": {"from_offset": 1000, "to_offset": 5000}}'
 WHERE name = 'orders-to-kafka';
-- The relay picks up the replay config, runs it, then removes the key.
```

- Does **not** advance the consumer group offset.
- Combined with `"dry_run": true`, shows what would be published.
- Useful for backfilling a new sink with historical data.

**Effort:** 1d

### B.10 OpenTelemetry Tracing

**Problem:** Phase 1 uses structured logging and Prometheus metrics.
Production deployments with distributed tracing (Jaeger, Tempo, Datadog)
need OpenTelemetry spans to correlate relay activity with upstream and
downstream systems.

**Design:** Optional OpenTelemetry integration using the `opentelemetry`
crate ecosystem.

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = true
exporter = "otlp"                         # otlp | jaeger | stdout
endpoint = "http://localhost:4317"        # OTLP gRPC endpoint
# service_name = "pgtrickle-relay"
# sample_rate = 1.0                       # 1.0 = trace everything
# propagation = "w3c"                     # w3c | b3 | jaeger
```

**Trace structure:**
- Root span: `relay.poll` (one per poll cycle)
  - Child span: `source.poll` (time spent polling source)
  - Child span: `sink.publish` (time spent publishing batch)
  - Child span: `source.acknowledge` (time spent acking)

**Context propagation:** For HTTP webhook sink/source, propagates trace
context via W3C `traceparent` header. For Kafka, uses `traceparent` header
on Kafka records. For NATS, uses `traceparent` NATS header.

**Crates:** `opentelemetry`, `opentelemetry-otlp`, `tracing-opentelemetry`

**Effort:** 1.5d

### B.11 Relay Dashboard

> **Deferred to Phase 3.** Full design: [PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md § C.1](./PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md#c1-relay-dashboard)

### B.12 Plugin System (Dynamic Backends)

> **Deferred to Phase 3.** Full design: [PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md § C.2](./PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md#c2-plugin-system-wasm-backends)

### B.13 Encryption Envelope

> **Deferred to Phase 3.** Full design: [PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md § C.3](./PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md#c3-encryption-envelope-kms)

### B.14 Webhook Signature Verification

**Problem:** Phase 1's webhook source accepts any POST to the configured
path. Production webhooks need cryptographic signature verification to
prevent spoofing.

**Design:** Support common webhook signature schemes.

```toml
[source.webhook]
listen_addr = "0.0.0.0:8080"
path = "/inbox"

# Signature verification (one of):
[source.webhook.signature]
scheme = "hmac-sha256"                    # hmac-sha256 | github | stripe | svix
secret = "whsec_..."
header = "X-Webhook-Signature"            # header containing the signature
# tolerance_seconds = 300                 # reject messages older than 5 min
```

**Supported schemes:**
- **HMAC-SHA256:** Generic `HMAC(secret, body)` → compare to header value
- **GitHub:** `sha256=HMAC(secret, body)` in `X-Hub-Signature-256`
- **Stripe:** Stripe-Signature header with timestamp + HMAC
- **Svix:** Standard webhook signature scheme (used by many SaaS platforms)

**Effort:** 1d

## Part E — Connector Ecosystem Integration (Phase 3)

> **Full details:** See [PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md](./PLAN_RELAY_CLI_PHASE_3.md)

Phase 2 ships the **Singer protocol** adapter (A.11) because its low effort
and massive ecosystem make it the highest-value connector integration. The
remaining connector ecosystems are planned for Phase 3:

| Ecosystem | Protocol | Direction | Effort | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Airbyte** | JSON-lines (AirbyteRecordMessage) | Source + Sink | 2.5d | ~95% overlap with Singer adapter; thin translation layer. Second-largest open-source EL ecosystem. |
| **dlt** | Python streaming / REST API | Source + Sink | 2d | Fast-growing Python-first EL tool; strong dbt synergy (complements `dbt-pgtrickle`). |
| **Redpanda Connect (Benthos)** | YAML-config, NDJSON | Source + Sink | 1.5d | Hundreds of built-in connectors; relay emits/consumes Benthos-compatible NDJSON or HTTP input. |
| **Fivetran** | HTTP sync API + HVR callbacks | Source (webhook) | 1d | Proprietary; webhook source can act as Fivetran connector endpoint. |

These build on the Singer infrastructure (subprocess I/O, JSON-lines parsing,
state checkpointing) and benefit from being implemented together.

### Effort Summary

| Phase | Effort |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 2a — Cloud Provider Parity | 9d |
| Phase 2b — IoT, Analytics, Data Lake & Connectors | 10.5d |
| Phase 2c — Operational Excellence | 13d |
| Phase 2d — Testing & Polish | 6d |
| Phase 2e — Documentation & Distribution | 2d |
| **Total** | **~40.5 days solo / ~26 days with two developers** |

Phases 2a and 2b (backends) can be parallelised with Phase 2c (extensions).
With two developers, one focuses on backends while the other builds
operational features.

### Dependencies

- **Requires Phase 1 (v0.25.0)** — all Phase 2 work builds on the
  Source/Sink trait framework, relay loop, config system, and metrics
  from Phase 1.
- **Schema Registry (B.2)** requires access to a Confluent Schema Registry
  or Apicurio instance for integration testing.
- **Cloud backends (A.1–A.4)** require emulators or test accounts:
  - GCP Pub/Sub: `google/cloud-sdk` emulator
  - AWS Kinesis: LocalStack
  - Azure Service Bus: Limited emulator support — may need a test instance
- **Object Storage (A.8)** uses MinIO for S3-compatible testing.
- **ClickHouse (A.9)** uses the official Docker image.

## Open Questions

| # | Question | Options | Recommendation |
|---|----------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Should Phase 2 be a single release or split across versions? | (a) Single v0.26.0, (b) Split: v0.26.0 (backends) + v0.27.0 (extensions) | **(b)** — split reduces risk. Ship backends first, extensions second. |
| 2 | Should Event Hubs use the native SDK or just document Kafka protocol? | (a) Native SDK, (b) Document Kafka config only | **(a)** — native SDK for better Azure identity integration. Document Kafka as alternative. |
| 3 | Should transforms support languages beyond JMESPath? | (a) JMESPath only, (b) Add CEL (Common Expression Language) | **(a)** for Phase 2. JMESPath is well-known and sufficient. |
| 4 | Should the plugin system use WASM or shared libraries (.so/.dylib)? | (a) WASM (sandboxed, portable), (b) Shared libs (faster, easier) | **(a)** — WASM is safer and more portable. But defer to Phase 3. |
| 5 | Priority: Schema Registry or DLQ first? | (a) DLQ, (b) Schema Registry | **(a)** — DLQ is universally needed. Schema Registry is use-case dependent. |
| 6 | Should Elasticsearch full-refresh use alias rotation or delete+reindex? | (a) Alias rotation (zero-downtime), (b) Delete + reindex | **(a)** — alias rotation is the standard Elasticsearch practice. |
| 7 | Should we support ClickHouse via HTTP or native protocol? | (a) HTTP (simpler), (b) Native (faster) | **(a)** for Phase 2 — HTTP is simpler and well-supported by the `clickhouse` crate. |
